# Inferring-efficacy-with-RJAGS
On March 22, 2021, Astrazeneca released the results of the phase III trial of their vaccine. From their analysis, it turned out that the vaccine efficacy at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 is 79% and the efficacy against severe or critical disease and hospitalisation is 100% [1]. The results were presented with no uncertainty and, because of how efficacy is defined, do not indicate the likelihood that the next patient will be protected by the vaccine. This created confusion not only in the media, but more importantly about how people interpreted these results, even those with specialized backgrounds. For this reason, I attempted to extrapolate, from the few published data, the full probability density (pdf ) of efficacy.
